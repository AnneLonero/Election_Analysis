## Overview of Election Audit:
This is an election audit of the tabulated results for a US congressional precinct in Colorado. The process for this audit is automated using Python. The goals are reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. Later one, we also use the same process to determine the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highes turnout.

## Election-Audit Results:
Base on the data provided, we identify this following information

Denver county leads with the largest number of votes - **306,055** votes which is **82.8%** of total vote counts.
Jefferson county is second with **38,855** votes casted which is **10.5%** of total vote counts.
And last is Arapahoe county with **24,801** votes or **6.7%** of total vote counts.

On the other hand, Diana DeGette is winning with **272,892** votes which is **73.8%** of total vote counts.
Charles Casper Stockham follows with **85,213** votes (**23.0%** of total votes counts).
And come last is Raymon Anthony Doane with **11,606** (**3.1%** of total votes counts).

## Election-Audit Summary:
The method using in the election audit can be modified and use for future election. This Python code can run multiple candidates, since the code was written flexible that no limit to the number of candidates in the poll. The code can run and find different candidates name and pull the vote count from the entire data set.

This program can also run other reports based on the metrics provided. For example, instead of county, if the Zip Codes provided, we can run the report of vote count based on this information as well.
